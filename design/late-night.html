			<p id="description">
				this poster was created as part of my application to what is now my position on the editorial staff of <a href="http://fourbyfourmag.com/">4&times;4 literary magazine</a>.
				the entire image was created from scratch, and the "late night" text was hand-lettered.
				</br></br>
				per the application guidelines, i came up with the theme "late night" for a potential open-mic event.
				the "late night" text was inspired by retro neon light signage.
				the light globes in the background were inspired by the <a href="http://www.ysl.com/corporate/us/saint-laurent-collections/menss14/">saint laurent spring 2014 menswear show</a> stage.
				</br></br>
				i intended set off the slightly kitsch lettering with the sleek light matrix behind.
