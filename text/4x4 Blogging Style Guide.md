4×4 Blogging Style Guide
========================

By [Ben Kogan](http://benkogan.com). Last updated 2014-02-22.

This guide is a work-in-progress. As such, it is very much still open to interpretation and discussion. Important information is still missing, and may be added as necessary.

The web editor is responsible for updating and maintaining this guide. Because he or she is in charge of visual consistency and quality across the entire website, the web editor has the final say on what will appear on the website, and may make changes to blog content as necessary.

## Expectations

The blogging editor is in charge posting to the 4×4 blog. This involves a mixture of posts written by the editor and written by contributors, as organized by the editor. The blogging editor must proofread these posts, ensure that they adhere to this style guide, and then post them to the 4×4 blog.

Posting to the blog involves various steps. The editor must ensure posts are visually styled in a way that is attractive, functional, and adheres to this guide. The editor must ensure that all posts contain a “featured image.” The editor must ensure that all contributors are properly credited. The editor must maintain consistency in style and form between all posts. Please read this guide thoroughly and refer back to it as necessary to ensure that the 4×4 blog is the best that it can be.

## Posting

Instructions in progress.

Posts should be added as drafts. The web editor must be contacted before publishing a post for the final sign-off, following which a post may be published publicly.

## Written Style

4×4 Magazine should be written using the multiplication symbol, not an “x” character. On a Mac, you can find this from the `Edit > Special Characters` menu item. If all else fails, copy the character from this document.

- **good:** 4×4
- **bad:** 4x4 or 4X4

Quotations should use double quotes, as per the American-style, with single quotes reserved for quotations-within-quotations. They should be curly quotes, not straight quotes. Similarly, please use curly apostrophes and not straight apostrophes (also known as the “prime” character.

- **good:** “Ben said ‘I can’t drink milk.’”
- **bad:** "Ben said 'I can't drink milk.'"
- **also bad:** 'a quotation'

Use proper em (—), en (–), and hyphen (-) dashes. On a Mac, an em dash is created with `shift+option+-`, en with `option+-`, and a hyphen is simply the `-`, or hyphen, key. Some examples of each (from [grammarbook.com](https://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/dashes.asp)):

- **em dash:** I pay the bills—she has all the fun.
- **em dash:** You are the friend—the only friend—who offered to help me.
- **em dash:** I wish you would—oh, never mind.
- **en dash:** The years 2001–2003; January–June
- **en dash:** North Carolina–Virginia border
- **en dash:** a high school–college conference
- **hyphen:** hair-raiser
- **hyphen:** a one-way street
- **hyphen:** chocolate-covered peanuts

## Visual Style

Our current Wordpress theme, Watson, includes a number of visual styles for blog text. Use these to enhance the content and add visual interest to the text without detracting from the content. To access these styles, make sure you have selected the “kitchen sink” button, which is in the upper-right corner of the toolbar above the text entry field. You can check which styles have been applied to a given portion of text by highlighting it and checking the `Path` listed below the text entry field. The default path for un-styled text is `Path:p`.

To maintain visual consistency between posts, a couple of conventions are in place. The first few words (say, between two and five) should be in the `run in` style. The first paragraph should be in the `excerpt` style. The last paragraph should be in the `end` style.

Occasionally it may be necessary to offset a small portion of text in color. For this, use the website’s standard red, as defined by the hex value `#D00F18`. One example that uses this red is [Mahima’s interview](http://fourbyfourmag.com/2014/02/interview-mahima-chablani/).

When using `sidenote`, be conscious of how this displays desktop versus mobile browsers. In the former, the text begins next to the paragraph beneath it. In the latter, the text appears in place. Try not to disrupt the flow of an article on mobile, but not to move critical text out of view on the desktop.

## Images

Every post must contain at least one image. The primary—and often, the only—image is what is discussed in this section.

The primary image can come from a staff or contributing photographer, the design team, or the web editor. The blogging editor is responsible for trying to find an appropriate image for every post. Failing this, the web editor may aid in coordinating the production of an appropriate image.

The primary image should be added by choosing the `set featured image` link in the bottom right of the add new post page. This image **must** exceed 1216 pixels wide × 800 pixels high, and *should* conform to the same 38/25 width-to-heigh ratio. Furthermore, this image **must** be submitted as an uncompressed PNG file, unless it is a photograph, in which case a high-quality JPG image is acceptable.

After uploading new images, the blogging editor **must** prepare image files for high-resolution screens. First, go to `Media > WP Retina 2x` in the Wordpress sidebar. Then, hit the `Refresh issues` button. Once the “Issues has been refreshed.” text appears, hit the `Generate` button in the top left. A counter will appear on the right indicating the progress of the generate action. *Please wait until this process has fully completed before exiting the WP Retina 2x page.* This process may take a couple of minutes; however, it is absolutely essential that it is completed prior to publishing a post.

## Credit

Instructions in progress. Please reference [this post](http://fourbyfourmag.com/2013/12/editors-split-quarto-form-new-lit-mag/) for an example of how to credit an article from a source other than 4×4. Please ensure that all for all posts, images are credited to their respective creators, as per the example.
